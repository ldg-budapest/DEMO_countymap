# DEMO_countymap
A minimalist example on how to draw and color a map in R

## Usage
Please install __tidyverse__ and __officeverse__ packaes, as well as the __sf__ packages that drwas the actual map.  
County border coordinates are in **SHP** shapefiles and need to be downloaded (e.g.: from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-hun), as this data is not maintained within the repo.  
A notebook is available to showcase the map and there is a script that generates editable slides with the help of officeverse.
